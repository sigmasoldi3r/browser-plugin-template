# Manifest templates

Most information about the output manifests are from
the `package.json` file (Name, description and version),
and the `options.json` file, found in this same folder.

> **warning**
>
> If you update or change the template files for
> either, firefox or chrome, be aware that you will
> need to update the `postprocess.js` file.
